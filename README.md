# How to use #
In the current stage of development, this website is no publically accessible, 
meaning that you have to download the files from this repository and access them on a local server.

# About #
This project was initially made to refine my Webdevelopment skills without the usage of external website building tools.

What did I do?
- I was setting up a mySQL database
- I programmed a register and login site using PHP/SQL
- I integrated session handeling into my website
- I refined my frontend and UI/UX development skills to ensure a good user experience
